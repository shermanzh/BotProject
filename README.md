## Overview

This project is designed and intended to utilize Selenium's library of automation tools to create a program that can track and notify you of price changes to Amazon's website.

The project is written in Python, which utilizes Selenium's automation tools to scrape a provided website for item prices, and returns the scraped data to the user. The website (currently restricted to Amazon wishlist) will be inputted into the program as it runs(WIP), and then outputted to the user.

Eventually, the program will track prices for you automatically throughout a period of time, and notify you when a price drop is detected within the product list.
